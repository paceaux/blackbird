[Download and install the .net SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/aspnet/blazor-tutorial/install)

Then in VSCode try
```bash
dotnet watch run --project Blackbird
```

## What does this do?

Gets data from [congress API](https://gpo.congress.gov/) and shows it.

Also it still contains a Blazor to-do example just for reference.
